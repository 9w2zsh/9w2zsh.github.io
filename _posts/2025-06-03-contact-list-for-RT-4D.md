## Editing DMR-id contact list for RT-4D radio

Rob W1AEX [DMR-id contact list for RT-4D](https://www.w1aex.com/dmrid/dmrid.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawKr5yZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFJSmZOOFpoYUlydUY5eHNUAR7xHLMBk181EI_854CLdM_IsB3EuzMJwpM4nYG-JHhIZcAZnswcRjFk4SD7sw_aem_wANg9N1biMt9cyztCdsl9w) explains the DMR-id csv files downloaded from RadioID.net [RadioID.net](https://www.radioid.net).

He only use CSVed [CSVed download page](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/csved.html) and Notepad++ [Notepad++ page](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). While I was struggling to edit the list using csv file opened using MS Excel!. Bunch of cut and paste and I end up frustrated with the result.

The steps that he put up works for RT-4D radio. But I can use the same method for other radio codeplug such as Alinco, Anytone or Baofeng.
