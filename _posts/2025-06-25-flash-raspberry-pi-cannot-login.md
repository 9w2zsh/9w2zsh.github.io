## Flash a new sd card

I wanted to install ASL3 on a new SD card so I flashed it with Raspberry Pi-0. I used root as the user and the password that I know. Surprisingly, when I plug in to Pi-0 and ssh to it, I cannot login as root even though i was using the right password.

The [forum](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=333248) on Raspberry Pi website has some suggestions
