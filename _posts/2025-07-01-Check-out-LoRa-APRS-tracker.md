## LoRa APRS tracker

Finally I own one of the LoRa APRS tracker. I am not sure how I will use it but its kinda interesting and almost every amateur radio operator has one. So.. what not.

Now when it shows on [aprs.fi](https://aprs.fi), it always has the wording "TERENGGANU DX ARRES" where I purchase the APRS tracker. I am not part of the club so I asked how do I blank that field out. Turn out to be I will need VS Code, clone the project [LoRa_APRS_Tracker](https://github.com/richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_Tracker) by [Ricardon Guzman](https://github.com/richonguzman) and flash the firmware to the tracker
