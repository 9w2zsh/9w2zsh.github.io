## LoRa APRS tracker

Finally I own a LoRa APRS tracker. I am not sure how I will use it but its kinda interesting and almost every amateur radio operator has one. So.. why not.

However, when I on the tracker, on [aprs.fi](https://aprs.fi), it always has the wording "TERENGGANU DX ARRES" on the station info. I bought from them but I am not part of the club.

So I asked how do I blank out that field. Turn out to be, I will have to use VS Code, clone the project [LoRa_APRS_Tracker](https://github.com/richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_Tracker) by [Ricardon Guzman](https://github.com/richonguzman) and flash the firmware of the tracker.
