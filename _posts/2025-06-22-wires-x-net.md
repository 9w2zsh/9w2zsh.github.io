## Wires-X net on America-Link

International Wires-X run net on Saturday night (local time) which is Sunday morning Malaysia (UTC+800). I happen to catch it couple of time, sometimes by coincidence. how lucky am I.

## Topic of the net

The neat part, their net will have topics to talk about rather than just people checking in as the other regular net does. This week the topics are:
* What is your first ht radio
* What is the ht radio you use right now
* Which one is your favourite ht radio to use

As expected, most ham station that checked in has at least 5 or more ht and they playing game like trying to catch up with what other people has. hi hi
