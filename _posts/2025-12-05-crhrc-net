## Listening to the net

I was listening to the net and one of the guy check in and mentioned about tracking MH370 using WSPR. I cannot help myself to jump in and thank that guy. Will find his callsign later.

This week the topic is joke, any good joke or bad joke. One guy check in and ask, did anyone claim the roll of money tied with a rubber band that fell off during the ham fest last week. If he did, tell him I found the rubber band. I guess that's pretty funny. Good one buddy!
