## No work - off day

I was on my daily call with my boss and we were planning on what to do for the day. Happen to be there's no specific task that I need to do for the day. Since its a bit quiet and we don't have any pressing case, my boss said it's the best time to take leave, to clear the remaining leave balance I have for the year. And on leave I am :)
