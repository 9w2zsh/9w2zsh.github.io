## Online resume

The idea of online resume on personal website seems more professional and elegant.

## Several templates available 

Jekyll always has nice templates for almost everything including resume. Just look for the one that you like and either use the template or fork it to your own repository and you can make the adjustment yourself. I use the template by sharu725/online—cv.

Still learning the concept as if I forked the repo, am I still attached to his. I want to be able to just handle my own, how?
