## TS1 or TS2?

I was QSO with 9W2YD regarding the Ben, VK2AFK. When I saw on the Nextion display of my duplex MMDVM running DMR shows that I transmit both in TS1 and TS2. 

One of my AllStarLink hotspot also has been on and off intermittently. The time and IP address announcement works as usual, however connecting to the node using Alltune page. Using Supermon2 also failed to get connected. Not to mention DVSwitch where I cannot connect to local node 1999 to connect to DMR talkgroup. Using Node Remote app on my phone sometimes can get me connected to other node, sometimes it doesn't.

I guess its been too long. I need to revive all the hotspot and make sure all connections and configuration work as how they should. sigh..
