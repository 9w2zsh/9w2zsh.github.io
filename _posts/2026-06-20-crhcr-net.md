## Topic: What is the first antenna that you build

I shared my experience build a home brew slim-jim and put it up on my roof. My neighbor make a comment, ~"Your ligthning arrester looks different"~. So I have to take the liberty of explaining about the antenna and what ham is all about

Another story is how I was working with MC 101 antenna, try to get 1:1 on SWR meter. I started to cut the antenna, test and not getting the reading that I wanted, keep cutting, until the 1/2 wave antenna become 1/4 wave antenna!

## Kingsville station

Finally I heard station from Kingsville, KI5RSR.  
I was telling the net that I used to stay at the apartment on West Santa Gertrudis St.

## Great net

As always, great topic and enjoy the net!
