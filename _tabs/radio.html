          <p>
            I first started digital mode on DMR. My first DMR radio is the
            Anytone AT878UV with no bluetooth.<br /><br />
            My second digital radio is FT70D which I like it very much due to
            its simplicity to operated. Finally I got FT5D as my primary radio
